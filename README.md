## Contributions

Waiting for your contributions! In special, language translation and English correction are wanted:)

## How to contribute

### Clone & test
Fork and clone this repository. And next, in the directory `npm install` and `bower install`. Then, `gulp build && gulp serve` and you can see site on localhost.

To update swift version, `bundle install` then `bundle exec functions:create` and `bundle exec functions:convert`. There are other convenient rake tasks. To see tasks, type `bundle exec rake -T`.

### Translation

In `src/l10n` directory, there are translation files.

### Add new language

Copy `locale-en.json` and name your locale. Then, update the contents of the new translation file. After that, give me pull request. I'll add required file changes.
